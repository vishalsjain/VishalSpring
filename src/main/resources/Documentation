***Transaction Management****

----ACID----
Atomic: it says all transaction is commited or rollbacked.
COnsitency:COnsistent data in DB. e.g: DB will never have constraint violation.
Isoated:Multiple transaction can work in parallel, and it should not impact other transaction.locking
Durable:Change to transaction is persisted in DB.

           ISOLATION
@Transactional(isolation=Isolation.READ_COMMITTED,propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED,rollbackFor = Exception.class)
DirtyRead:Transaction A write some data in DB while B read same data and meanwhile A revert transaction. here B still have old data
NonRepatableRead: A and B read data whie after this B commit data,now when a again read data it get some other data.
               it is mainly for one row hence updates are one.only UPDATE/DELETE.
PhantomRead:A read range of data while B insert data which satify that range.Now when A read same data its condition gets satisfied.
           Since it is range of record which means multiple rows.INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

ReadUncommited,-->no isolation
ReadCommited,-->prevent dirty read.
Repetable_read-->revent dirty read and,non repetable read
Seriazable-->all

            PROPOGATION
REQUIRED:it uses same transaction if exist to commit or rollback transaction.
REQUIRES_NEW
NESTED
MANDATORY: it says transaciton should alredy exist if not then it wl throw exception
NEVER: opposite of mandatory.

For transaction service we use transactiontemplate, which needs TransactionManager and datasource as dependent reference object.
 transactionTemplate.execute(new TransactionalCallback<>(){
 public void doInTransaction(TransactionStatus ts){

 }

 })
